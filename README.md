# Affinity

[Site:](https://affinity.the-styx.net)

Affinity was born as an Honors Project idea for [CS571 Building User Interfaces](https://cs571.org/) at UW-Madison. Throughout the course, we delved into creating front-end interfaces using JavaScript, along with libraries like React and React Native. Additionally, we explored various user design principles and techniques, with Affinity Diagramming being one of them.

Currently, I host the site on my own server (I have colocated), which was also fun to set upâ€”from configuring the reverse proxy to building and deploying the application with Nginx.

### Project Goals:

- Create a frontend interface from scratch.
- Learn TypeScript.
- Utilize new packages and libraries, such as [dndkit](https://dndkit.com/).

### Future Plans:

- Implement some form of persistence to the program, starting with session storage initially.
- Refactor the code for better readability and maintainability.
- Explore creating a canvas to allow users to move containers anywhere on the screen, akin to draw.io. Additionally, enabling users to customize colors would enhance the user experience.
- Work on setting up a backend in Go, as it presents an intriguing opportunity to learn the language.
